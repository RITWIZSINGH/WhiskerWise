# Gemini AI App

Gemini AI App is a Flutter application that allows users to capture or upload images of animals and receive detailed analysis regarding their suitability as pets, dietary requirements, activities, special care needs, and more. The app uses Google's Gemini 1.5 model to process and analyze the images.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Upload an image from the gallery or capture a new one using the camera.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** The app uses the Gemini 1.5 model to provide detailed analysis of the animal in the image.
- **Information Display:** The analysis results are displayed in a user-friendly manner, highlighting key points about the animal.
